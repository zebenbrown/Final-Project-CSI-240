## Archival Note: Student Project (Spring 2024)

Please note: This is a final project from a university course completed in the Spring of 2024. The build is dependent on a specific development environment and libraries from that time and is no longer actively maintained. The source code is preserved here as a portfolio piece to demonstrate the concepts and skills learned.
